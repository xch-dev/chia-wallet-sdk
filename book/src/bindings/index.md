# Bindings

The Chia Wallet SDK provides bindings for multiple languages, allowing you to use the SDK's functionality from your preferred programming environment.

## Available Bindings

- [Node.js](./nodejs.md) - Use the SDK in JavaScript/TypeScript applications
- [Python](./python.md) - Use the SDK in Python applications
- [WebAssembly (WASM)](./wasm.md) - Use the SDK in web applications

Each binding provides access to the same core functionality, with language-specific adaptations for idiomatic usage.

## Common Features Across Bindings

All bindings provide access to:

- Key management (creating, deriving, and using keys)
- Address handling (encoding and decoding addresses)
- Transaction creation and signing
- Network interaction (querying the blockchain and submitting transactions)
- Working with special assets like CATs (Colored Coins) and NFTs
