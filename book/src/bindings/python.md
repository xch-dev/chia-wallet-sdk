# Python Bindings

The Chia Wallet SDK provides Python bindings that allow you to use the SDK's functionality in Python applications.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install chia-wallet-sdk
```

## Usage

Import the classes and functions you need:

```python
from chia_wallet_sdk import (
    SecretKey,
    PublicKey,
    Signature,
    Address,
    Coin,
    SpendBundle,
    Clvm,
    CoinsetClient
)
```

## Key Management

Create and work with keys:

```python
import os

# Generate a new key from seed
seed = os.urandom(32)  # Create a random 32-byte seed
sk = SecretKey.from_seed(seed)

# Get the public key
pk = sk.public_key()

# Sign a message
message = b"Hello, Chia!"
signature = sk.sign(message)

# Verify the signature
is_valid = signature.is_valid()
```

## Working with Addresses

Convert between puzzle hashes and addresses:

```python
# Create an address from a puzzle hash
puzzle_hash = bytes([0] * 32)  # Example puzzle hash (all zeros)
address = Address(puzzle_hash, "xch")

# Encode the address
encoded_address = address.encode()
print(f"XCH address: {encoded_address}")

# Decode an address
decoded_address = Address.decode(encoded_address)
```

## Creating Transactions

Use the CLVM (ChiaLisp Virtual Machine) to create transactions:

```python
clvm = Clvm()

# Create a coin
parent_coin_info = bytes([0] * 32)  # Example parent coin ID
puzzle_hash = bytes([0] * 32)  # Example recipient's puzzle hash
amount = 1000  # Amount in mojos
coin = Coin(parent_coin_info, puzzle_hash, amount)

# Create a simple spend
conditions = []
conditions.append(clvm.create_coin(puzzle_hash, 900))
conditions.append(clvm.reserve_fee(100))

delegated_spend = clvm.delegated_spend(conditions)

# For a standard transaction
standard_spend = clvm.standard_spend(pk, delegated_spend)
clvm.spend_standard_coin(coin, pk, delegated_spend)

# Get the coin spends
coin_spends = clvm.coin_spends()

# Create and sign the spend bundle
aggregated_signature = Signature.aggregate([signature])
spend_bundle = SpendBundle(coin_spends, aggregated_signature)
```

## Interacting with the Network

Connect to the Chia network and query coin records:

```python
import asyncio

# Connect to testnet
client = CoinsetClient.testnet11()

# Or connect to mainnet
# client = CoinsetClient.mainnet()

async def fetch_coins():
    try:
        # Get blockchain state
        state = await client.get_blockchain_state()
        print(f"Blockchain state: {state}")
        
        # Query coins by puzzle hash
        puzzle_hash = bytes([0] * 32)  # Example puzzle hash
        coin_records = await client.get_coin_records_by_puzzle_hash(puzzle_hash)
        print(f"Coin records: {coin_records}")
        
        # Push a transaction
        response = await client.push_tx(spend_bundle)
        print(f"Transaction result: {response}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(fetch_coins())
```

## Working with CATs (Colored Coins)

To create and manage CAT tokens:

```python
# To be implemented based on the detailed CAT API
```

## Working with NFTs

To create and manage NFTs:

```python
# To be implemented based on the detailed NFT API
```

## Error Handling

Handle errors from the SDK:

```python
try:
    # SDK operations
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error type: {type(e).__name__}")
    print(f"Error message: {str(e)}")
```

## Asynchronous Programming

Many functions in the SDK are asynchronous and should be used with Python's asyncio:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Asynchronous SDK operations
    pass

asyncio.run(main())
```
