This is a library for building applications that need to interact with coins on the [Chia blockchain](https://chia.net), including wallets and dApps (decentralized apps). However, it is _not_ a prebuilt wallet. If you are looking for that, you can use [Sage Wallet](https://github.com/xch-dev/sage), which is a light wallet built using the Wallet SDK that provides an RPC interface.

## Getting Started

To learn more about developing applications on Chia, I'd recommend reading [xch.dev](https://xch.dev).

There are also [Rust docs](https://docs.rs/chia-wallet-sdk/latest/chia_wallet_sdk) will get you going with the crate, and assume you are already familiar with Rust and Chia's coin set model.
